Hi, I'm Rishabh Dahale—a builder at heart, passionate about creating innovative solutions from scratch.

I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), where I had the opportunity to work on fascinating projects like [music generation](https://rishabhdahale.github.io/assets/pdf/DDP_Stage_2_Report.pdf) and [audio steganography](https://rishabhdahale.github.io/assets/pdf/audio_stego.pdf). My journey includes impactful roles at Qualcomm and various ventures where I honed my full-stack development skills.

My focus is on deep tech, AI, SaaS, and fintech, aiming to leverage technology to create solutions that improve lives. Whether it's micro SaaS products or AI-based tools, my goal is to push the boundaries of innovation.
